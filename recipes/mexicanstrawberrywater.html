        <h2>Description</h2>
        <P>Aguas frescas[1][2] (English: cool waters, lit.â€‰'fresh waters') are light non-alcoholic beverages made from one or more fruits, cereals, flowers, or seeds blended with sugar and water. They are popular in Mexico and some other Latin American countries, as well as parts of the United States such as the Southwest. Some of the more common varieties include tamarindo, jamaica, and horchata.</P>

        <p>Aguas frescas are sold by street vendors and are commonly found in convenience stores, restaurants and juice bars.[3]</P>
